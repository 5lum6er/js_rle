# Boilerplate for JS tasks

- Includes `eslint`
- Includes `pre-commit` hooks (eslint)
- Includes `ci` (travis-ci)

## Workflow

- Create separate branch for the solution. Name of the branch should be the same as name of your channel in slack. <br/> e.g. `git checkout -b fs_on_apr19_sasha`
- Implement the solution inside function scope in `src/rle.test.js`
- Make sure the solution works. Run tests (see `scripts` block below)
- Make sure the code is clean. Run eslint (see `scripts` block below)
- Push code to the repository in created branch<br/> `git push origin <branch_name>`
- Create `Pull Request` from your branch to `master`
- Send link of created `PR` to your coach / TA



## Scripts
- `npm run test` - run tests specified in `src/rle.test.js`
